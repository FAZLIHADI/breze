brummlearn
==========

Collection of machine learning algorithms.

This is a rather lose collection of machine learning algorithms implemented
by people from the BRML lab.

Here are some guidelines. Please...

- follow [pep8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) when writing
  code.
- write tests with [nose](http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/) to
  make sure other people don't break your code,
- follow the documentation guidelines of [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/),
  especially for docstrings. Here is an
  [example](http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html).
- In case you develop something new, please do so in a new branch 'feature-XXX'
  so you do not mess with other peoples work.

Have fun!
